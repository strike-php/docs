# What is Strike
Strike is a PHP framework which aims to have a small footprint but still provides
you with the tools that you need to build a solution for your business problem.
It comes in an easy to understand structure and with sensible defaults.
## Why I developed Strike
There are other frameworks like Laravel, Symfony or Slim out there which are 
all really good. I developed over a decade application in exactly these frameworks.
While doing this, there were always small things that I wanted to tie together in 
another way.  
Strike aims to fill the gap between very opinionated full stack frameworks, loosely 
coupled components like Symfony and micro frameworks like Slim.
